# Team SVR

For the **HackClub Educates 2.0** Hackathon, we chose the Domain of **AR/VR (Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality)** and the Sub-Domain of *Fashion*.  

In this day and age, especially in the times of the pandemic, online shopping has taken a rise. Not only this, while shopping online, we sometimes buy products that look great on screen, but doesn't suit us. With everything being digitalized, we believe using AR in the Fashion industry is the future. With AR, online shopping can be an experience, rather than a boring activity. Here, we can make the AR models of various pieces of clothing and people can see how it suits them, all within the comfort of their homes. This ensures clothing can be selected with ease and not only that, it saves time and money.

In this project, we have created a website, with the use of a Template (from Themewagon) and changed it according to our creative needs.  

Here we have used a One-Page website design, where we have showcased our use of Augmented Reality(AR) using the **echo3D** software. We also used *codepen.io* to get a few creative designs.

In order to use this Augmented Reality function:
1. Scroll to the clothes and locate the "AR Model" button
2. Click on the "AR Model" button and locate the QR Code of the respective piece of clothing
3. Using the Google Lens in the user's phone, scan the QR Code and click on the website link available on the phone screen
4. The link will re-direct the user to the Echo3d website, where the "See in AR" option can be located.
5. Click the "See in AR" option and see the piece of clothing appear before in an Augmented Reality fashion.

With this project, we hope to simplify and add "fun" into the online shopping experience. Not only this, we realize that the Domain of Augmented Reality has many applications and we have learnt a lot as to how it can be applied in the real world.
